      action: "The 30-Second Answer",
      body: "ChatGPT is faster. Claude is deeper.\n\nChatGPT excels at speed, breadth, and ecosystem (plugins, DALL-E, Custom GPTs). Claude excels at analysis, writing quality, and handling large documents.\n\nIf you need one: pick based on your primary use case. If you can afford both ($20/mo each): use ChatGPT for speed tasks, Claude for quality tasks.",

      body: "Both have free tiers. Both charge $20/month for Pro/Plus.\n\nChatGPT Plus ($20/mo): GPT-4o, DALL-E image generation, Code Interpreter, Custom GPTs, 50 GPT-4 messages/3hr.\n\nClaude Pro ($20/mo): Claude 3.5 Sonnet, 200K context window, Projects, Artifacts, priority access.\n\nFree tiers: ChatGPT free gives GPT-4o mini. Claude free gives limited Claude 3.5 Sonnet messages.",

      body: "Claude writes like a human. ChatGPT writes like a good AI.\n\nThe difference shows up in: professional emails (Claude sounds more natural), long-form content (Claude maintains voice better), and sensitive communication (Claude reads the room).\n\nChatGPT is faster at generating drafts. But if you're sending it to a client, run it through Claude.",
      whisper: "Test this yourself: give both the same writing prompt. You'll see the difference immediately.",

      action: "Coding — It Depends",
      body: "Quick bug fix? ChatGPT. It identifies issues faster and gives you working code with less back-and-forth.\n\nArchitectural decision? Claude. It asks clarifying questions, considers edge cases, and explains WHY, not just WHAT.\n\nPrototype? ChatGPT (ships faster). Production code? Claude (more careful).\n\nBoth are excellent. The difference is in how they approach problems.",
      whisper: "The best developers use both: ChatGPT for speed, Claude for the code that has to be right.",

      action: "Research & Analysis — Claude Wins",
      body: "Give both a 50-page PDF. Claude reads it and gives you a structured analysis. ChatGPT summarizes the first few pages and starts making things up.\n\nClaude's 200K context window means it can hold entire books, codebases, or research papers in a single conversation. ChatGPT's context is smaller and degrades faster.\n\nFor anything requiring synthesis of large documents, Claude is the clear winner.",
      whisper: "Context window is Claude's superpower. If your task involves long documents, start there.",

      action: "Speed & Ecosystem — ChatGPT Wins",
      body: "ChatGPT responds faster. Period. For rapid-fire tasks (email replies, quick lookups, brainstorming), that speed compounds.\n\nThe ecosystem is massive: Custom GPTs for specialized tasks, DALL-E for images, Code Interpreter for data analysis, plugins for real-time data.\n\nClaude's ecosystem is growing (Projects, Artifacts) but ChatGPT has a 2-year head start.",
      whisper: "If you need 50 things done fast, ChatGPT. If you need 5 things done right, Claude.",

      action: "Honesty & Hallucinations",
      body: "Both hallucinate. Neither is a reliable source of truth.\n\nBut there's a key difference: Claude tends to say \"I'm not sure\" or \"I don't have enough information.\" ChatGPT tends to sound confident even when it's wrong.\n\nFor high-stakes tasks (legal, medical, financial), Claude's uncertainty is actually a feature. You know when to verify. ChatGPT's confidence can be dangerous.",
      whisper: "Never trust either as a sole source. But Claude at least warns you when it's guessing.",

      body: "Use ChatGPT when: speed matters, you need images (DALL-E), you want Custom GPTs, you're brainstorming, you need real-time web data, or you're doing data analysis.\n\nUse Claude when: quality matters, you're working with long documents, you need careful analysis, you're writing for humans, you want honest uncertainty, or you need the API.\n\nUse both when: the task is important enough to cross-reference, you want the two-pass workflow (ChatGPT draft → Claude polish), or you're making a big decision.",

      action: "The Two-Pass Workflow",
      body: "This is the secret that power users know:\n\nPass 1 (ChatGPT): Fast draft. Broad coverage. Multiple options. Get past the blank page.\n\nPass 2 (Claude): Refine. Add depth. Improve tone. Remove clichés. Make it human.\n\nThis works for: emails, blog posts, code, research, business plans, presentations. ChatGPT generates. Claude polishes. The result is better than either alone.",
      whisper: "The two-pass workflow is worth the price of this guide alone. Try it once and you'll never go back.",

ChatGPT for 80% of tasks (speed), Claude for 20% (quality).\n\nFree tier strategy: use ChatGPT free for quick tasks, save Claude free messages for important work.",
