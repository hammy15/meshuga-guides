Stop paying for both. Figure out which AI tool actually fits your work—ChatGPT or Claude—in 15 minutes.

## Main Product Description (Gumroad/Payhip)

**You're paying $20/month for ChatGPT. Or Claude. Or both.**

But which one should you actually be using?

ChatGPT is fast. Claude is thoughtful.  
ChatGPT generates volume. Claude adds depth.  
ChatGPT works for prototypes. Claude works for polish.

**The problem? Most people pick one and force it to do everything.**

That's like using a hammer for every job. It works. But it's not optimal.
